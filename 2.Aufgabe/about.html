            <h5>Brilliance and Wine over Beauty</h5>
            <p>My dad died when I was nine. In a car accident. I was with him in the car. While we waited for the ambulance, I tried to keep his chest closed so he wouldn’t bleed so much. When he died, my hands… felt his heart stop beating. That’s why I do this. It’s also why I win all the contests.</p>

            <h2>Buffy Summers</h2>
            <h5>In Case Of An Apocalypse</h5>
            <p>In every generation, one slayer is born…because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. This woman is more powerful than all of them combined. So I say we change the rule. I say my power…should be our power. Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence of the scythe to change our destiny. From now on, every girl in the world who might be a slayer…will be a slayer. Every girl who could have the power…will have the power…can stand up, will stand up. …every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?</p>
            <h5>About Buffy</h5>

            <h2>River Tam</h2>
            <h5>Killing With Her Brain</h5>
            <p>So we'll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of Eden. Eleven inherent metaphoric parallels already there. Eleven. Important number. Prime number. One goes into the house of eleven eleven times, but always comes out one. Noah's ark is a problem.</p>
            <h5>About River</h5>
            <p>River Tam is the teenage sister of Dr. Simon Tam, both of whom take refuge aboard Malcolm Reynolds' Firefly-class transport ship known as Serenity. She was a child prodigy, intelligent beyond her years and athletically gifted. After intense experimentation by Dr. Mathias on behalf of the Parliament, River was partially transformed into a mentally unstable psychic weapon intended for secret governmental use.</p>
